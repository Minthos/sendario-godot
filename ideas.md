== Dynamite launcher

Lob a stick of dynamite with a short fuse
(low bounce physics object)

It explodes, converting the nearest tile into blobs of dirt and whatever resources were in that tile
(tiles are not cubes like in minecraft but instead one tile is one vertex and when a vertex is removed the nearby vertices have their triangles recomputed)
Also sends anything nearby flying in all directions, including the freshly excavated dirt and resources
The resources will be immune to damage from the explosion that uncovers them but not from subsequent explosions

Remove the dirt, recover the resources, keep digging

Dirt that is left undisturbed for several days will merge into the terrain

Should store wheel tracks and footprints so players can easily find their way back to dig sites after returning to base with resources


== Drill winch

When your vehicle tips over you can get out of the vehicle and use the drill winch to drill a hole in the ground if there's nothing else to attach the winch to. Then you winch your vehicle upright. You may risk having to fight off hostile fauna while doing this depending on how dangerous the area is.


== Resource locations:


Craters
Fragments of the asteroid scattered on and below the surface
Large deposit buried underground where the bulk of the asteroid would have landed


Volcanoes
Some minerals are only found in cooled magma, others are found in the lakes in the crater, others are found anywhere around volcanoes


Rivers
Riverbeds contain small fragments of resources downstream of larger deposits


Caves
Natural caves can form stalagmites and stalagtites of rare minerals, and caves can expose buried resources


Underwater volcanoes
Small quntities of rare minerals only form near underwater vents and volcanoes


Asteroids
Asteroids in space can contain many of the same minerals that are found in craters, plus ices that evaporate during atmospheric entry and on impact


Anywhere on moons and planets
Many resources are randomly distributed on all rocky celestials in various concentrations


Habitable celestials
Biological resources and byproducts of biological processes are only found on habitable celestials


Archeological treasures
Buried ruins of ancient civilizations, buried bases and equipment from players who have stopped playing, bones and fossils of prehistoric fauna
