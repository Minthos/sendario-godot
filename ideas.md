Drill winch

When your vehicle tips over you can get out of the vehicle and use the drill winch to drill a hole in the ground if there's nothing else to attach the winch to. Then you winch your vehicle upright. You may risk having to fight off hostile fauna while doing this depending on how dangerous the area is.
