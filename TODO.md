1. Deformable terrain!

"16m" x "16m" tiles (subject to distortion by mapping a spheroid to a cube)
17x17 vertices per tile (edges get duplicate vertices)
explosions make small craters (unless they are big explosions...)
dirt flies everywhere
maybe find some resources




?. Saving terrain state, overall game state

?. Gray boxes represent buiildings, buildings take inputs on one side and eject outputs on the other side

?. RTS-like interface for placing building schematics but the construction ingredients must be moved to the construction site manually
don't worry about the actual constructing for now, just input resources and watch the building grow bigger
